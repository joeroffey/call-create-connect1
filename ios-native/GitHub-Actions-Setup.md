✅ Spins up a macOS machine with Xcode  
✅ Downloads your code  
✅ Builds your iOS app  
✅ Runs tests (if configured)  
✅ Creates an archive  
✅ Generates build artifacts  
✅ Makes everything downloadable  

### **What You Get:**
📦 **Build Artifacts** - Downloadable from GitHub  
📊 **Build Reports** - Success/failure status  
🔍 **Build Logs** - Detailed information  
⚡ **Fast Builds** - Usually 5-10 minutes

## ⚡ **CURRENT BUILD STATUS**

### **✅ What Works Now:**
- **Compilation** - App builds successfully
- **Testing** - Basic tests run in simulator
- **Archive Creation** - Build artifacts generated
- **Artifact Download** - Files available for download

### **⚠️ What Needs Setup for Device Testing:**

- **Provisioning Profiles**
- **Device Registration**

---

## 🔐 **UPGRADING TO SIGNED BUILDS**

When you're ready to create IPAs that run on actual devices:

### **Step 1: Apple Developer Account**
- Sign up at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
- Cost: $99/year
- Provides certificates and device testing

### **Step 2: Export Certificates**
```bash
# On a Mac (or ask someone with a Mac):
# 1. Create certificates in Xcode
# 2. Export as .p12 files
# 3. Convert to base64 for GitHub secrets
```

### **Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets**
In your repo: **Settings** → **Secrets** → **Actions**
```
IOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64=<your certificate>
IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD=<certificate password>
PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64=<your profile>
```

### **Step 4: Update Workflow**
Change this line in `.github/workflows/ios-build.yml`:
```yaml
if: false # Change to 'true' to enable signed builds
```

## 🎯 **TESTING OPTIONS**

### **Current Testing (No Certificate Required):**
- ✅ **Build Verification** - Confirms code compiles
- ✅ **Simulator Testing** - UI tests in iOS Simulator

## 📊 **BUILD MONITORING**

### **Where to Check Status:**
1. **GitHub Actions Tab** - Real-time build status
2. **Commit Checks** - Green ✅ or red ❌ next to commits
3. **Pull Request Checks** - Build status on PRs
4. **Email Notifications** - GitHub can email you results

### **Build Information:**
- **Duration** - Usually 5-10 minutes
- **Cost** - FREE (GitHub provides 2000+ minutes/month)
- **Success Rate** - High once initially configured
- **Parallel Builds** - Multiple builds can run simultaneously
